### Submission Guide

Make sure you use the normal GitHub and Heroku process. This time, though, you need to include screenshots and/or a video showing us that you got the app working with no bugs. You can include these screenshots or a link to a video in a `README.md` file.

If you haven't written a markdown file yet, [click here for a rundown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), or just take a look at the raw file of these instructions.
